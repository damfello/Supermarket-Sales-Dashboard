Supermarket Sales Dashboard: In this project I develop an interactive data dashboard, based on a data set that contains information about the sales of a Supermarket for the year 2023-2024.
The dashboard consists of six main visuals with which you can analyze the evolution of daily, monthly and annual sales.
Sales by product, sales channel or payment method are also obtained.
The dashboard contains four interactive filters with which you can filter the data by time periods, sales channel or payment method.

Data Model: To design the data model, a fact table has been linked, where purchases are recorded, and a dimension table, where the characteristics of the products in the supermarket are recorded.

Calculated Measures: It was necessary to create four calculated measures, using DAX language
